XMonad Configuration
====================

This is a fairly simple configuration, but I think that some others may find it useful. Feel free to send me a pull request for anything or fork this project.

I have borrowed heavily from http://dmwit.com/volume for my dzen alert configuration. I basically copied what's in that blog post, abstracted away the Double specific code in dmwit's alert function (namely show and round), and added the ability to display the current local time (12 hour). My reasoning behind this is that status bars take up precious screen real estate, and I only really need them for the time. Plus this allows me to focus in on what I'm working on, rather than constantly checking the time. Just be careful you don't accidentally stay up too late!

My plan is to incorporate more alerts; text messages would be really cool, but that may be more work than it's worth. I don't really see myself putting a lot more into this - what I like most about tiling window managers is that they get out of the way. Nevertheless, I will add functionality as I need it, and hopefully someone else can gain something from this being up here.
